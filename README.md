# Kandan

## Running this demo

1. Install and start Datomic (TODO: friendlier instructions here)

2. Clone this repo

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:datodev/kandan.git
    cd kandan
    git submodule update --init
    ```

3. Start the figwheel server. Figwheel compiles the frontend assets,
recompiles them when the files change, and updates the browser with
the changed code.

   `lein figwheel` or `rlwrap lein figwheel`

4. Start the web server. Export a few environment variables to get
things working on your system. The Kandan example uses environ, so you
can also define env variables in a local profiles.clj.

    ```
    export DATOMIC_URI="datomic:free://localhost:4334/kandan" # This will depend on your datomic setup
    export NREPL_PORT=6005 # starts embedded nrepl server
    export DATO_PORT=8081 # 8080 is the default value, change it if there is a port conflict
    export PORT=10556 # 10555 is the default
    lein run
    ```
